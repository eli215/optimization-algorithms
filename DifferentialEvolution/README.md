# Differential Evolution

Differential Evolution is an evolutionary optimization algorithm which is structured into generations and populations. As the name implies, this algorithm is based upon biology, namely the processes of mutation and crossover. Given an initial population of solutions, each generation makes random mutations and keeps the changes if they prove to be favorable. The number of generations, population size, mutation factor & crossover probability factor are a few of the variables which can be manipulated for fine-tuning. There are also 10 different mutation strategies to choose from/alternate between. DE has proven to be a very versatile and powerful optimization algorithm.
